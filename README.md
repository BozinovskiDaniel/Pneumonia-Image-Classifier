# COMP9417 ML Project

This repository is a Machine Learning project created for <b>COMP9417 @ UNSW</b>.

We dive into classifying if a patient potentially has Pneumonia based on their medical images.

## Overview

We are challenged to build an algorithm to detect for Pneumonia in medical images. 

## Backstory

Pneumonia accounts for over 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old internationally. In 2015, 920,000 children under the age of 5 died from the disease. In the United States, pneumonia accounts for over 500,000 visits to emergency departments and over 50,000 deaths in 2015, keeping the ailment on the list of top 10 causes of death in the country.
