## Overview

An existential problem for any major website today is how to handle toxic and divisive content. [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) wants to tackle this problem head-on to keep their platform a place where users can feel safe sharing their knowledge with the world.

We will be developing a machine learning model that attempts to accurately identify and flag insincere questions.
